# Syllabic-Drift-Calculator
An attempt to solve a means over time problem.

##
How much does the poetry of two given cultures blend into each other based on close interaction. And does cross-cultural influence reduce the further in time and space cultures are isolated.

## Syllabic Drift Formula

```
SD = M ( means ) ^ T ( Time + Interval Increase )
```

The average mean syllabic count increases over time based on an interval the mean value between different syllabic line lengths of different poetry forms.
